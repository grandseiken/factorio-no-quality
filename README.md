# No Quality

This mod allows you to play Space Age without the quality mechanic, or extra quality-selection steps in any filter/recipe GUIs.

(Note: since Space Age depends on the Quality mod, which contains things like the graphics for the recycler machine, you cannot just disable the Quality mod if you want to play Space Age.)

This mod removes:

* Quality modules
* Quality tiers other than "normal"
* Related technologies and achievements.
