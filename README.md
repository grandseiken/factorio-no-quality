# No Quality

This mod allows you to play Space Age without the quality mechanic, or extra quality-selection steps in any filter/recipe GUIs.

(Note: since Space Age depends on the Quality mod, which contains things like the graphics for the recycler machine, you cannot just disable the Quality mod if you want to play Space Age.)

## Why would you want this?

Once you have researched the quality mechanic, a significant number of in-game UIs (e.g. setting recipes, filters or signals anywhere) become more cumbersome and require more clicking to operate. So if you don't plan on interacting with quality and want to keep the simpler UI, you could use this mod to avoid any chance of that happening.

## This mod removes:

* Quality modules
* Quality tiers other than "normal"
* Related technologies and achievements.
